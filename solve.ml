(*
 * Run Knuth's algorithm X. Return a list containing the indices of rows in the
 * exact cover.
 *
 * Since we'll want to eventually use a sparse array for dancing links, we'll
 * pass in lists for the rows and for the columns. Otherwise, taking the
 * transpose of a sparse array will not be fun. The first part of a tuple in a
 * list is the index, the second part is the actual row/column. We may have to
 * modify this for dancing links (e.g. every entry in a row also needs a column
 * int).
 *
 * NOTE: We'll have to keep rows and cols in sync. Is there a better way to 
 * handle dancing links? I think arrays will cause lots of pain later on.
